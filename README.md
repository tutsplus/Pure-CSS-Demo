Pure-CSS-Demo
=============
Today, we will be making a beautiful, minimal dashboard using Pure (https://github.com/yui/pure/), the new mini-CSS module library from Yahoo!. We will be talking about and using some of the principles of SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS). We'll also be using icons from WeLoveIconFonts.com.
